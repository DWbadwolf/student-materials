# Title
Ride Share APPLICATION

## Executive Summary
This Application is a ride share service unlike other services that charge a higher fee certain hours of the day. this would be a more local and simplified ride services only operating in a 35 miles radius but in cities without fast reliable public transportation.
*Your executive summary should be pretty brief, under 3 paragraphs and should provide a concise summary of the purpose and contents of the rest of the document.  Explain to the reader what they will get from this document.*

## Business Objectives

Scheduling and coordination of project resources are a core responsibility of Project Management to ensure that the project maintains its schedule. PMs will work with stakeholders and team members to coordinate and communicate the schedule, as well as adjustments to the schedule as they arise.

The scope of the project refers to the breadth of work to be done. Frequently we underestimate or overestimate the scope of a project. This causes scope changes to be a frequent occurrence in the life of a PM. It is the PM's responsibility to manage and coordinate changes in scope to ensure that the outcome of the project is satisfactory.

Some scope adjustments are negotiable, such as a stakeholder requesting an additional feature. Others, however, are non-negotiable such as identifying a critical bug while working on a feature. The PM must negotiate and manage expectations within the team and stakeholders when scope changes occur.

Project communication is essential to ensure that the team and stakeholders are both aware and comfortable with the progress and direction of the project. The PM will typically produce reports at regular intervals to communicate progress and risks. For many project management frameworks, the reporting structure is standardized to leverage common language and avoid confusion.

Stakeholders often deal in very high-level requests ("Let's build an email client"). The PM is required to break these high-level terms down into all of the sub-tasks which must be completed to satisfy the request.

This process is called a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS). A WBS is the process of starting with the desired outcome and working your way back to define 100% of the dependent tasks to deliver that outcome. This process produces a comprehensive scope of the project.

A WBS is neither a project plan, a schedule, nor a chronological listing. It specifies what will be done, not how or when.
## Background

*Provide any relevant background information regarding why this project is being initiated*

## Scope

*The Scope section should outline what is and is not included as part of this project.  Oftentimes we make assumptions of features or functionality that is not necessarily required.  This is especially useful in a phased approach or when working on an existing system.*

## Functional requirements

*This is where most of the detail should reside.  describe all of the required capabilities of the system in detail.  It is helpful to articulate features in terms of user capabilities.  Keep in mind that the features will be designed and developed off of these descriptions, so if you leave anything up to interpretation, you run the risk of the results not meeting your expectations.  You can also assume capabilities that are not mentioned here will not be included in the project, no matter how common or obvious they are.  You may want to break our subsections for each major feature to make the document more organized.*


## Personnel requirements

*In this section you may want to describe the composition of the team, do you need dedicated development?  how many people?  How about design or QA?  Think about what personnel is required to make this project a success, and place your recommendations here.*

## Delivery schedule

*It's often helpful to break a project out into phases or milestones.  In this section list out any logical checkpoints where you would like to see the project demonstrated to ensure that expectations are being met.  Describe the phase, and the functional requirements required for completion.*

## Other requirements

*This section serves as a catch-all for any details that may not fit in other areas.  things like device or browser support, considerations for accessibility or inspiration for style.  Offer additional context here to ensure the project meets your vision*

## Assumptions

*Oftentimes we are reliant on outside sources such as frameworks to be used, or services that our system will depend on.  In this section you should provide detail on any assumptions that you have made, such as the system being reliant on the availability of the Google Maps API.*

## Limitations

*Identify any limitations in terms of time, personnel, technical details, or other things that limit the scope, time, and cost of the project being discussed.*

## Risks

*Every project has inherent risks that may cause delay or even failure of a project.  You must identify this risks to show you know what they are, and also identify ways in which you would mitigate those risks.*
